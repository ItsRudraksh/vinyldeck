VinylDeck turns the track already playing on your system into a living turntable. Album art becomes the record label, extracted colors bloom through the scene, the needle breathes with the music state, and every control feels like part of a physical deck.

Built with Tauri, Rust, React, and Windows media integration, VinylDeck is designed to feel native, lightweight, and quietly dramatic.

## Highlights

- **Works with system media** - reads Windows media sessions from apps such as Spotify, browsers, and VLC.
- **Cinematic vinyl rendering** - animated record motion, album-art label, physical tonearm, ambient bloom, film grain, and glass/noir shells.
- **Native desktop feel** - main, fullscreen, and compact mini-player modes with tray lifecycle.
- **Opt-in startup** - launch with Windows when you want VinylDeck ready as a quiet companion.
- **Real media controls** - play, pause, previous, next, and seek flow through Windows SMTC when supported by the active source.
- **Persistent settings** - visual and behavior preferences sync across app windows through the Rust backend.
- **Keyboard-first polish** - focused shortcuts, keycap hints, custom tooltips, and a right-click command menu.

## Preview

VinylDeck is a desktop-first visual player, not a streaming service. Start music in your usual app, open VinylDeck, and the active system session becomes the deck.
